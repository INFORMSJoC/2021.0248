# Data for replication
The folder `SSD/data` contains four datasets used in the experiments of Section 5.4 for testing second-order stochastic dominance constrained portfolio optimization problems. The datasets are distributed under the term of the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://github.com/INFORMSJoC/2021.0248/blob/master/SSD/data/LICENSE) (CC BY 4.0).

All four datasets **DAX_26_3046**, **DowJones_29_3020**, **DowJones_76_30000** and **SP100_90_3020** come from the [page](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/uryasev/research/testproblems/financial_engineering/portfolio-optimization-with-second-orders-stochastic-dominance-constraints/?) which contains the case study used in the following paper:
